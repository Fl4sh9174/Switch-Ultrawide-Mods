# Where are the mods?

Mods are located in mods/GameName[SerialNumber]

Inside the .zip files, you'll find:

- Ultrawide mods (adjusted HUD when possible)
- FPS mods (60FPS, 120FPS, 240FPS, etc., depending on the game)
- Resolution mods, up to 8K+
- And much more!

## How to install

On Emulators(Yuzu/Ryujinx forks)

Right-click on the game for which you want to install the mod.
Open the mod data location.
Extract the zip file there.

After extracting the mods, you can select which mod you want to enable or disable on both emulators.

On Switch you can convert the files to IPS when necessary.

I will always try to add up to 4K/8K resolution when possible.
Mods are optimized for a resolution of 3440x1440. Any help or suggestions will be appreciated.

All the files inside mods folder are necessary, some mods contains cheats file, pchtxt file and V2.pchtxt files, dont delete any of these.
If you encounter any issues with the mods, please let me know opening an issue.

All mods are free, but if you want to support me: https://ko-fi.com/Fl4sh9174
