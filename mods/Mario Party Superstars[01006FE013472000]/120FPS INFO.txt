Some Issues:
Using custom dice block will crash the game.
Gamespeed is normal but some minigames may softlock and timers can desync.
e.g:Piranha's pursuit is impossible to beat without using a turbo mode...
All the methods i've tried, fix some parts and break others.

The mod is experimental and i leave it here so you can see how the game looks at 120fps
if i fix the remaining issues i'll update the mod.
