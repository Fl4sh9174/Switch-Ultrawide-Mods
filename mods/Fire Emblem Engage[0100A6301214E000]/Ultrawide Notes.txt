The game doesn't let me adjust the HUD/UI using the resolution. If I do that, the aspect ratio
will be correct, but the screen will be cropped really badly.

In the Ultrawide mod, the aspect ratio is correct for all parts of the game, including the
panning camera. The only issue is the characters closer to the UI; they can't be adjusted 
independently. If I find a solution, I'll update the mod with the fix.

The Ultrawide camera mod adjusts the distance of the camera to show the same image as the 
Ultrawide mod, but it won't fix the aspect ratio of the game like the Ultrawide mod. However,
it does fix the characters on the UI.

Both mods can be used together for a wider view, but the issue with the UI remains.
