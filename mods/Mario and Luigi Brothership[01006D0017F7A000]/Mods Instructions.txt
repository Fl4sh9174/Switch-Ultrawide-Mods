- 3840x2160 requires Extended memory layout for any emulator
- Speed Hack work only on Switch/Yuzu and its forks
- Ultrawide mod cannot be used with other resolution mods

Emulators are a bit unstable with this game, i recommend using CPU Accuracy in Accurate for Yuzu/Sudachi/Yuzu Forks, performance is worse but less visual glitches.

In Ryujinx you can try OpenGL if encountering issues with Vulkan, there are some visual glitches using opengl but it can help with crashes, do your own tests.
