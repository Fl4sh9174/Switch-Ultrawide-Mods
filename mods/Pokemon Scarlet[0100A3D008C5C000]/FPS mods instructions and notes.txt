Dynamic FPS mods will adjust the correct gamespeed based on the current FPS.

The two versions included work very similarly, but some users reported issues with the exlaunch version when playing online,
so I made another version (ASM) that fix it. (If you still having issues, use the 60FPS static version for online mode).

I tested the ASM patch online mode on Yuzu and its forks and its working fine, also working on Ryujinx/Kenji-NX

- Working on v3.0.1 and 4.0.0
- Use one FPS mod at a time
- Fixed Stutter indoors
- Fixed Stutter while walking or running
- Fixed windmills animations speed and distance
- Fixed npcs animations speed
- Fixed menu speed
- Fixed battle's animation speed
- For a better visual experience you can use the [Improved Graphic Quality]
- If you encounter any issue, let me know
- Mod is capped at 60FPS to avoid visual issues, unlocking FPS above 60 will speedup the game.
- Added a function to smooth the FPS
- Tweaked all the FPS mods to reach better frametimes (less stutter when loading a new area/assets)
- Switch users should use Exlaunch or 60FPS static version

Pok√©mon softlocking when evolving isn't related to my mods, its an emulation issue, there are some workarounds floating the web.
